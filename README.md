_**1. Return of Investment**_

a\. Email campaigns have the highest conversion rate (9.57%) and a relatively high ROI (5.48%). This suggests that email marketing is highly effective for driving conversions and offers a decent return on investment.

b\. Influencer and Social Media are strong in conversions (8.03%, 7.81%), but the ROI is lower (4.99%, 4.97%), perhaps due to higher costs or more indirect benefits. These two campaigns could drive a lot of engagement but the spending costs may reduce profitability compared to other channels.

_**2. Conversion Rate**_

a\. Website channel have the lowest conversion rate (6.78%) while impressions are average among other channels, suggesting that improvements might be needed in the user experience, landing page optimization, or call-to-action effectiveness. 

b\. Among all the campaign channels, influencer campaigns on Facebook(8.04%), Instagram(8.03%), and YouTube(8.02%) show solid performance which is listed for top 5, with slight variations. Facebook seems to be the most effective for influencer-driven conversions, but Instagram and YouTube also provide significant conversion potential, particularly for visually engaging products or services.

c\. The conversion rate by target audience is significantly same (~8%) indicates  campaigns may not require significant adjustments for specific segments. This can save time and resources, as you donâ€™t have to create highly specialized content or messaging for different audiences.

d\.Email and Google Ads are the most effective channels for all target audiences, contributing to the highest conversion rates.

_**3. Impression**_

a\. Email campaigns and channels  are performing strongly, with both the highest impressions(0.26bn) and conversion rate (9.57%), making it a highly effective channel for driving conversions. The combination of high reach and high conversion suggests that email is a crucial channel for engaging customers.

b\. Display ads campaigns have the lowest impressions(0.19 billion) but similar click performance to other channels like email and social media, suggesting that although reach is limited, engagement is consistent. It performs adequately in terms of clicks but could be less effective for broad exposure.

_**4. Clicks**_

a\. Search campaigns achieve a high number of clicks (0.25 billion) with a better click-through rate compared to other campaign types making it an efficient channel for driving traffic. It seems to offer the best balance of impressions and clicks, indicating strong engagement.

b\. Social media is performing similarly to influencer campaigns in terms of impressions (0.21bn, 0.22bn) and clicks (0.02bn). It may need more engaging content to boost click performance and indicates these are more useful for awareness than driving high engagement.

_**Recommendation**_
1\. Since Email and Google ads are performing well, create high quality content which is valuable and relevant that addresses the specific needs of your audience segments. This can improve engagement and drive conversions.

2\. Improve user experience in Website channels by simplifying the steps users need to take to complete a conversion and refine the user experience based on feedback and performance metrics.

3\. Identify more influencers within the company niche to partner with. Focus on those who have a strong connection with their audience to create more engagement. Experiment with different content types on social media to engage users and potentially improve conversion rates on social media marketing.
